# 🎅🏻 Advent of Code 2024 🎄

Welcome to my advent of code repo for 2024. Hopefully I'll make it past day 2
this time! 😅

I'm going to be completing these challenges in Rust, to give me some practice
with it.

## Lessons Learned (or re-learned 😅)

- Day 2 - Premature optimization is the root of all evil. Make it fast, _then_
  make it fast.
- Day 3 - Ungodly regexes might be fun but they're rarely the answer. Each regex
  should do one thing.
